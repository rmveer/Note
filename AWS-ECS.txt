----------------- Amazon Web Services Elastic Container Service [ECS AWS ] --------------------

*Amazon Web Services is a cloud provider that offers a verity of services such as compute power,dtabase storage,
content delivery and other resouraces to help businesses scle and grow.
*AWS services can be used to create and deploy any applications in the cloud.

*Schedules the placement of containers across your cluster.Two physical hosts join togeather called cluster.ECS will
helps us to place containers, Where should be container place either in host1 or host2 that logic defined in ECS
we can define that logic.
(Lets take two containers want to interact heavylly you do want to place them in a different hosts[server] 
you would place them in a one single host so that they can intract with each other that lgic define by us )
*It is a scalable service which can be accessed through the AWS Management Console and software development kits(SDKs).

*We can launch container serviceses and these containers through AWS management console and also we can launch through
SDKs available from AWS, we can launch through Java, .Net ‚ÅØNodeJ languages.

* ECS also will also helps to migrte the application to cloud without changing the code.Like no need to worry about 
changing the IPS Storage what are the parameter to include.
