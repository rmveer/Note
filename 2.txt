ARG:
	ARG instructons defines a variables in Docker file that can be use building the image
	ARG values are not available after the image built
	In the running container you can't access the ARG variables
	Once ARG variables is defined in the dockerfile, you can alaways override the values by passing command line
	argument
	If we need to pass 2 variables using CMD line then we need to use --build-arg two times
	We can have multiple ARG instruction in a dockerfile
	ARG is the only instruction that can precede the FROM instruction in the dockerfile (means we can put the ARG 
	instruction before the FROM instaruction in a dockerfile).

ENV
	ENV is to provide defult values for our feature environment varibales inside the container
	We can't change ENV variable using command line argument directly
	If we need to change the ENV variable using CMD line thne we have to use ARG varibale in ENV variable
