to check the syntax of a playbook ansible-playbook <playbooknemw.yml>  --syntax-check
defult varibales in Ansible---> inventory_hostname, items

we can also mention ansible path inside the ansible playbook to get path which anible-playbook
so that it will give the path /usr/bin/ansible-playbook

instead of mentioning --- at starting of ansible playbook we can go for the path as
#!/usr/bin/ansible-playbook

and we should excute this playbook instead of i=using anible-playbook <playbook.yml> ,, ./<playbook.yml >
Note: the yml file should have excute permission so that make confermation and if not give permission by sudo chmod -R +x <playbook.yml>
